# Secret key
# ~~~~~
# The secret key is used to secure cryptographics functions.

# This must be changed for production, but we recommend not changing it in this file.

# The application languages
# ~~~~~

# Global object class
# ~~~~~
# Define the Global object class for this application.
# Default to Global in the root package.
# application.global=Global

# Ws timeout config
ws.timeout.connection=35000
ws.timeout.connection=${?WS_TIMEOUT_CONNECTION}
ws.timeout.idle=60000
ws.timeout.idle=${?WS_TIMEOUT_IDLE}

# Router
# ~~~~~
# Define the Router object to use for this application.
# This router will be looked up first when the application is starting up,
# so make sure this is the entry point.
# Furthermore, it's assumed your route file is named properly.
# So for an application router like `my.application.Router`,
# you may need to define a router file `conf/my.application.routes`.
# Default to Routes in the root package (and conf/routes)
# application.router=my.application.Routes

# Database configuration
# ~~~~~
# You can declare as many datasources as you want.
# By convention, the default datasource is named `default`
#

# Evolutions
# ~~~~~
# You can disable evolutions if needed

# Logger
# ~~~~~
# You can also configure logback (http://logback.qos.ch/),
# by providing an application-logger.xml file in the conf directory.
#
# ! Logging is configured in logback.xml, must disable logging here, 
# if not it will override logback.xml configuration. 
#
# Root logger:
#logger.root=ERROR

# Logger used by the framework:
#logger.play=INFO

# Logger provided to your application:
#logger.application=DEBUG
